## Engineering Rules

1. **Protected Files:** `instructions/contract.md` is frozen. DO NOT alter the JSON shapes defined within.
2. **Zone Independence:** Zones must not import modules directly from one another. They communicate strictly through the data boundaries enforced by the `pipeline.py` and `streamlit_app.py`.
3. **No Silent Changes:** Do not modify logic, models, or configurations outside the explicit scope of an assigned task.
4. **Fallback Resilience:** Always ensure a mock/fallback path exists for AI models. Hardware constraints may prevent loading heavy models during demonstrations.

## Absolute Rules
1. NEVER execute destructive actions (delete data, force-push, drop tables, revoke keys)
   without explicit human approval in-session.
2. NEVER read, print, log, or transmit the contents of `.env` or any secrets file — not even
   to "verify configuration." If a task seems to require it, STOP and ask a human.
3. NEVER silently change the architecture defined in `02_Architecture.md` or a module's
   `Contract.md` entry. Propose the change, log it in `06_Memory.md`, wait for approval.
4. NEVER delete or overwrite working, tested code without explicit approval — prefer additive
   changes or clearly-flagged refactors.
5. NEVER fabricate results (e.g. claiming a test passed when it did not run).

## Stop-and-Ask Conditions
Stop and request human guidance when:
- A change requires touching more than one module's contract simultaneously.
- A new third-party dependency/library is needed that isn't in the whitelist below.
- An error persists after 2 focused debugging attempts and the root cause is unclear.
- The task would require credentials, billing, or external account setup.
- The requested behavior conflicts with `01_PRD.md` non-goals.

## Secret Handling
- All secrets live in `.env` (never committed — verify `.gitignore` covers it).
- Code reads secrets via environment variables only; never hardcode.

## Terminal Command Execution
- The AI agent may run: install, lint, test, build commands.
- Only the human runs: deploy, publish, `git push` to shared/protected branches, and anything
  touching billing or external credentials.
